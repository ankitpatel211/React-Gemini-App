# Getting Started with a Conversational Chatbot App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:backend` to run a server on port 8000
This runs the server that listens to all incoming requests and responds to the client.

### `npm run start:frontend` to run react app in a browser
Runs the app in the development mode.
In your web browser, navigate to the web page already running at URL: http://localhost:3000, or type the URL to access the web content.

### This is how a conversational chatbot app looks like:

You can type in your question to start a conversation with a Gemini model, or you can also click on the 'Surprise Me' button for a surprise in the same manner.
